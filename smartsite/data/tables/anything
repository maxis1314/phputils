KPDRE9D	In the year 2004 i entered Nanjing university with a top 10 score. In the year 2009, i graduated from the department of computer science of  Nanjing university.  And was admitted in to a japanese company from 300 candidates.  I got the highest salary at that time the company could offer. Then i worked in shanghai for about one year before i was sent to headquarters in tokyo. From that on, i worked in tokyo for about four years. In 2008 i entered the biggest online broadcasting company in japan, and began to work with streaming technology. I have developed various sites, both used for PC or cell phones. And we even developed a search engine of our own. I like the development of software because it can bring much more efficiency. And make life much better. I also develop my personal web sites and family java soft during my free time.  that all thank you	2010/01/02 15:37:26	2010/01/02 15:48:45
